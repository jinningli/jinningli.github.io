      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Drawing a beautiful painting is a dream of many people since childhood. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme LINE ARTIST to synthesize artistic style paintings with free- hand sketch images, leveraging the power of deep learning and advanced algorithm.</p>
<p>Our scheme includes three models. The Sketch Image Extraction (SIE) model is applied to generate the train- ing data. It includes smoothing reality images and pen- cil sketch extraction. The Detailed Image Synthesis (DIS) model trains a conditional adversarial net to generate re- ality detailed information. The Adaptively Weighted Artis- tic Style Transfer (AWAST) model is capable to combine multiple style image with content via VGG19 network and PageRank algorithm. The appealing stylized images are then generated by optimization iterations.</p>
<p>Experiments are operated on the Kaggle Cats dataset and The Oxford Buildings Dataset. Our synthesis results are artistic, beautiful and steadier. Real sketch tests prove that our scheme performs very well on reality environments. With different artist styles, our scheme can generate paintings of various styles. With our scheme, everyone can draw a beautiful picture only by drawing a sketch and then feed- ing it into our system.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[DANCINGLINES, An Analytical Scheme to Depict Cross-Platform Event Popularity]]></title>
      <url>/archives/DancingLines.html</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Nowadays, events usually burst and are propagated online through multiple modern media like social networks and search engines. There exists various research discussing the event dissemination trends on individual medium, while few studies focus on event popularity analysis from a cross-platform perspective. Challenges come from the vast diversity of events and media, limited access to aligned datasets across different media and the great deal of noise in the datasets.</p>
<p>In this paper, we design DancingLines, an innovative scheme that captures and quantitatively analyzes event popularity between pairwise text media. It contains two models: TF-SW, a semantic-aware popularity quantification model, based on an integrated weight coefficient leveraging Word2Vec and TextRank; and wDTW-CD, a pairwise event popularity time series alignment model matching different event phases adapted from Dynamic Time Warping. We also propose three metrics to interpret event popularity trends between pairwise social platforms.</p>
<p>Experimental results on eighteen real-world event datasets from an influential social network and a popular search engine validate the effectiveness and applicability of our scheme. DancingLines is demonstrated to possess broad application potentials for discovering knowledge of various aspects related to events and different media.</p>

<p>In course CS348, Computer Vision, our coursework is to write a paper and submit it to a conference.</p>
<p>My Partners are Siqi Liu and Mengyao Cao. After discussion, we decided our draft topic as:</p>
<p>A Painting AI based on Cascaded Refinment Network</p>
<p>The PPT illustrates our scheme:</p>

<p>The final topic will be confirm in tomorrow’s class.</p>
<p>Wish our project a brilliant success!</p>
<h1 id="section-1">2017.10.25</h1>
<p>This time, I read a paper named <strong>A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</strong>.</p>
<p>This paper is about generating a picture with given real picture and a Painting. The generated picture will have both the feature of the painting and the initial picture.</p>
<p>For example, this is the painting used: <img src="/assets/rain-princess.jpg" alt="rain-princess"></p>
<p>Then, the Algorithm will produce a picture like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/assets/dome-afremov.png" alt="dome-afremov">
<p class="caption">dome-afremov</p>
</div>
<p>It is so amazing!!</p>
<h3 id="the-paper">The paper</h3>
<p>The method of the paper is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Use the VGG-19 network to process the initial picture, noted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span>, and the painting, noted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span>, then at each layer, the nerwork will have some feature maps corresponding to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Input a noise picture <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> to the network, also, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> will also have some featuremaps at every layers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Define a loss function between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{p}\)</span>, called content loss. And a loss function between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{a}\)</span>, called style loss.Then, the author define a compound loss function:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="math display">\[L_{total}(\mathbf{p}, \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{x})=\alpha L_{content}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{p}) + \beta L_{style}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{a})\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the optimization method to maximize the <span class="math inline">\(L_{total}\)</span>, and with this process, fix the noise picture <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{x}\)</span>. Then, the noise picture will become the finally result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can actually change the ratio between <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> to change the ratio of content and style.</p>

      <title><![CDATA[Memory Management in Linux]]></title>
      <url>/archives/system_note_1017.html</url>
      <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="memory-in-linux">Memory in Linux</h2>
<h3 id="page-allocation">Page Allocation</h3>
<p>Linux uses the <strong>Buddy algorithm</strong> to effectively allocate and deallocate blocks of pages.</p>
<p>The page allocation code attempts to allocate a block of one or more physical pages. Pages are allocated in blocks which are powers of 2 in size. That means that it can allocate a block 1 page, 2 pages, 4 pages and so on. So long as there are enough free pages in the system to grant this request (nr_free_pages &gt; min_free_pages) the allocation code will search the free_area for a block of pages of the size requested. Each element of the free_area has a map of the allocated and free blocks of pages for that sized block. For example, element 2 of the array has a memory map that describes free and allocated blocks each of 4 pages long.</p>
<p>The allocation algorithm first searches for blocks of pages of the size requested. It follows the chain of free pages that is queued on the list element of the free_area data structure. If no blocks of pages of the requested size are free, blocks of the next size (which is twice that of the size requested) are looked for. This process continues until all of the free_area has been searched or until a block of pages has been found. If the block of pages found is larger than that requested it must be broken down until there is a block of the right size. Because the blocks are each a power of 2 pages big then this breaking down process is easy as you simply break the blocks in half. The free blocks are queued on the appropriate queue and the allocated block of pages is returned to the caller.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/free-area.gif"> Figure 3.4: The free_area data structure</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4 means 4, 5, 6, 7 is free, size = 4 page</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>if page_1 become free, combine with page_0 to be size of 2, page_1 and page_0 is good buddy instead of page_2</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>use map to judge if they’re buddy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, in Figure 3.4 if a block of 2 pages was requested, the first block of 4 pages (starting at page frame number 4) would be broken into two 2 page blocks. The first, starting at page frame number 4 would be returned to the caller as the allocated pages and the second block, starting at page frame number 6 would be queued as a free block of 2 pages onto element 1 of the free_area array. ### 3.5 Memory Mapping &gt; who need virtual? &gt; - loading program &gt; - malloc &gt; - stack &gt; - code dynamic linking &gt; - mmap</p>
<ul>
<li>Find : task_struct -&gt; mm_struct -&gt; vm_area_struct -&gt; page table(页表) -&gt; page</li>
</ul>
<p>When an image is executed, the contents of the executable image must be brought into the processes virtual address space. The same is also true of any shared libraries that the executable image has been linked to use. The executable file is not actually brought into physical memory, instead it is merely linked into the processes virtual memory. Then, as the parts of the program are referenced by the running application, the image is brought into memory from the executable image. This linking of an image into a processes virtual address space is known as memory mapping.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/vm_area.gif" alt="vm_area"> Figure 3.5: Areas of Virtual Memory</p>
<p>Every processes virtual memory is represented by an mm_struct data structure. This contains information about the image that it is currently executing (for example bash) and also has pointers to a number of vm_area_struct data structures. Each vm_area_struct data structure describes the start and end of the area of virtual memory, the processes access rights to that memory and a set of operations for that memory. These operations are a set of routines that Linux must use when manipulating this area of virtual memory. For example, one of the virtual memory operations performs the correct actions when the process has attempted to access this virtual memory but finds (via a page fault) that the memory is not actually in physical memory. This operation is the nopage operation. The nopage operation is used when Linux demand pages the pages of an executable image into memory.</p>
<p>When an executable image is mapped into a processes virtual address a set of vm_area_struct data structures is generated. Each vm_area_struct data structure represents a part of the executable image; the executable code, initialized data (variables), unitialized data and so on. Linux supports a number of standard virtual memory operations and as the vm_area_struct data structures are created, the correct set of virtual memory operations are associated with them.</p>
<h3 id="the-linux-page-cache">The Linux Page Cache</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/page-cache.gif" alt="page-cache"> Figure 3.6: The Linux Page Cache</p>
<p>The role of the Linux page cache is to speed up access to files on disk. Memory mapped files are read a page at a time and these pages are stored in the page cache. Figure 3.6 shows that the page cache consists of the page_hash_table, a vector of pointers to mem_map_t data structures.</p>
<p>Each file in Linux is identified by a VFS inode data structure (described in Chapter filesystem-chapter) and each VFS inode is unique and fully describes one and only one file. The index into the page table is derived from the file’s VFS inode and the offset into the file.</p>
<p>Whenever a page is read from a memory mapped file, for example when it needs to be brought back into memory during demand paging, the page is read through the page cache. If the page is present in the cache, a pointer to the mem_map_t data structure representing it is returned to the page fault handling code. Otherwise the page must be brought into memory from the file system that holds the image. Linux allocates a physical page and reads the page from the file on disk.</p>
<p>If it is possible, Linux will initiate a read of the next page in the file. This single page read ahead means that if the process is accessing the pages in the file serially, the next page will be waiting in memory for the process.</p>
<p>Over time the page cache grows as images are read and executed. Pages will be removed from the cache as they are no longer needed, say as an image is no longer being used by any process. As Linux uses memory it can start to run low on physical pages. In this case Linux will reduce the size of the page cache.</p>
